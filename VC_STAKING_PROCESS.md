# VC Staking Process - What Happens When You Stake

## 🔄 Automatic Process

When you click "Setup USDC & Stake", here's what happens automatically:

### Step 1: Trustline Check ✅
- **Checks if you have a USDC trustline**
- **If missing:** Creates trustline to testnet USDC automatically
- **If exists:** Proceeds to staking

### Step 2: USDC Staking ✅
- **Transfers 1000 testnet USDC** from your wallet to the contract
- **Registers you as a verified VC** in the system
- **Records your company name** on-chain

### Step 3: VC Verification ✅
- **You become a verified VC** instantly
